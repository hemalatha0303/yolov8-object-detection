# YOLOv8 Object Detection with Custom Dataset

A powerful and efficient **YOLOv8 Object Detection** project, tailored to detect custom objects in images. This project leverages the **Ultralytics YOLOv8** model and is trained on a custom dataset to perform high-performance object detection.

## Features
- Real-time object detection with YOLOv8
- **Custom Dataset** Training
- Outputs images with bounding boxes on detected objects
- **Easy Setup** with clear instructions
- **Supports multiple objects detection** (e.g., cars, animals, etc.)
- Train the model using your dataset by following the training instructions.
- After training, use the model to detect objects in new images.
