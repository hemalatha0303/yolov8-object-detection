**#YOLOv8 Object Detection with Custom Dataset**

This project demonstrates the use of YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8) for object detection on custom datasets. It uses the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model to train and detect objects in images. The dataset used for this demonstration is the COCO8 dataset, and the model is trained to detect multiple objects such as cars, dogs, and more.

**#Features**
- YOLOv8 for real-time object detection.

- Custom Training: Trained on the COCO8 dataset.

- Inference on Images: Detects objects in a given image and saves the results.

- Saved Detection Labels: Saves the detected objects' information in a text file.

- Display Detected Image: Displays the detected image with bounding boxes.
